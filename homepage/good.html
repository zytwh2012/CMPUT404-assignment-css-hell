          <h2>Furture Career</h2>
          <p>Through the internship experience, I learned a lot about web application development in both front-end and back-end. For front-end, I was able to redesign pages from an existing project to fit a new project’s art style and need for responsive layout using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, TypeScript and framework Angular 2. For back-end, I am exposed to data transition between frontend and backend using Node.js and AJAX. I have also enhanced my relational databases knowledge, especially in MySql by writing queries for search functions.
          Besides technical skills I have learned how to communicate with team members efficiently when facing problems requires collaboration and acquired interpersonal skills required to maintain good working relationships with them. I am motivated to meet deadlines with little oversight but I will request help from supervisor when I truly need it to speed up developing progress. 
          With five years of studying experience in Canada, I am fluent in both English and Chinese (Mandarin). I am confident that my passion for programming and willingness to work hard will benefit your company in the furture.
